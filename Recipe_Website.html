                                <h3>Instructions</h3>
                                <p>
                                    1. Prepare the Rice:
                                    Rinse the basmati rice under cold water
                                    until the water runs clear. Soak the rice in water for 30
                                    minutes. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Drain the
                                    soaked rice and add it to the boiling water. Cook the rice
                                    until it is 70-80% cooked (it should still have a slight
                                    bite to it). Drain the rice and set it aside. 
                                    2. Prepare Saffron Milk: Warm the milk in a small saucepan over low
                                    heat. Add the saffron strands to the warm milk. Let it
                                    infuse for a few minutes until the milk turns golden yellow.
                                    3. Prepare the Vegetables: Peel and chop the vegetables into
                                    bite-sized pieces. Heat 1 tablespoon of ghee or oil in a
                                    large skillet or pot. Add the mixed vegetables and sauté
                                    them for 5-7 minutes until they are partially cooked. Remove
                                    the vegetables from the skillet and set them aside. 
                                    4.Prepare the Biryani Masala: In the same skillet or pot, heat
                                    the remaining ghee or oil. Add the whole spices (bay leaves,
                                    cloves, peppercorns, cinnamon stick, cardamom pods) and
                                    cumin seeds. Sauté for a minute until the spices become
                                    fragrant. Add the sliced onions and cook until they turn
                                    golden brown. Stir in the minced garlic, grated ginger, and
                                    slit green chilies. Cook for another 2 minutes. 
                                    5. Layering the Biryani: Reduce the heat to low. Spread half of the
                                    partially cooked rice evenly over the onion mixture in the
                                    pot. Sprinkle half of the chopped tomatoes over the rice.
                                    Spread half of the sautéed vegetables over the tomatoes.
                                    Sprinkle half of the chopped mint leaves and cilantro leaves
                                    over the vegetables. Drizzle half of the yogurt evenly over
                                    the vegetables. Repeat the layers with the remaining rice,
                                    tomatoes, vegetables, mint leaves, cilantro leaves, and
                                    yogurt. 
                                    6. Final Assembly: Pour the saffron milk over the
                                    assembled biryani. Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid.
                                    Cook the biryani on low heat for 20-25 minutes, or until the
                                    rice and vegetables are fully cooked and aromatic. Once
                                    done, remove the pot from the heat and let it rest for 5-10
                                    minutes before removing the lid. Garnish the biryani with
                                    fried cashews before serving. 
                                    7. Serving: Gently fluff the biryani with a fork to mix the layers. Serve hot with raita
                                    (yogurt dip) or any side of your choice.

                                <p>
                                    Prepare the Ingredients:

                                    Wash the tomatoes and pat them dry with a paper towel.
                                    Slice the tomatoes into ¼ inch thick slices. Similarly, slice the mozzarella cheese
                                    into similar-sized slices.
                                    Pick fresh basil leaves from the stems and wash them gently. You can leave them
                                    whole or tear them into smaller pieces if preferred.
                                    Assemble the Salad:

                                    On a serving platter or individual plates, start by layering the tomato slices.
                                    Place a slice of fresh mozzarella on top of each tomato slice. You can alternate
                                    between tomato and mozzarella slices for a visually appealing presentation.
                                    Tuck fresh basil leaves between the tomato and mozzarella slices, distributing them
                                    evenly across the plate.
                                    Season the Salad:

                                    Drizzle extra virgin olive oil over the assembled salad. Use a good quality olive
                                    oil for the best flavor.
                                    If desired, sprinkle a pinch of salt and freshly ground black pepper over the salad
                                    to enhance the flavors. Remember that mozzarella can be slightly salty, so adjust
                                    the seasoning accordingly.
                                    Optional Garnish:

                                    For an extra touch of sweetness and acidity, you can drizzle balsamic glaze or
                                    balsamic vinegar over the salad just before serving. This step is optional but adds
                                    depth of flavor to the dish.
                                    Serve:

                                    Once assembled and seasoned, the Caprese Salad is ready to be served immediately.
                                    Serve it as a refreshing appetizer or side dish alongside crusty bread or as a light
                                    accompaniment to your main course.
                                    Tips:

                                    Use ripe but firm tomatoes for the best texture and flavor.
                                    Similarly, opt for fresh, high-quality mozzarella cheese for the authentic taste of
                                    Caprese Salad.
                                    You can customize the salad by adding additional ingredients like olives, pine nuts,
                                    or a drizzle of pesto sauce for added flavor variation.
                                    Prepare the salad just before serving to maintain its freshness and vibrant colors.
                                    Enjoy your delicious and refreshing Caprese Salad!
